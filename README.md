This is a java spark web project which uses CI(travisCI), CD(Heroku) for my BIL481-Software Engineering Assignment.

In addition to the assignment, I have used Bootstrap to make the form in page look nice, also added a simple code to redirect the get requests from the root to the compute directory.
